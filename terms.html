      <h3>SmartPass - Restrictions</h3>
      <p>This App is intended to improve password hygiene and prevent credentials hacked from one account being used to break into other unrelated accounts. The App does not store passwords neither does it generate true random passwords. Instead it uses the key data you enter to create a repeatable ('sudo-random') passcode that is different for each domain (or App) name.</p>
      <p>The key data consists of a 'memorable' word and a numeric PIN. If either of these are deleted and lost then it will not be possible to recover any generated passcodes.</p>
      <p>Remember this App should be used as an aid to on-line security and ultimately the user is responsible for their own on-line security. There are a number on on-line resources that can inform the user of the strength of the generated passcode and it is their responsibility to ensure that this is sufficient for sensitivity of the data it is being used to protect. For very sensitive information (including financial information) it is recommended that two factor authentication be used</p>
      <p>It is also the user's responsibility to ensure that their mobile device is adequately protected against mendacious use and in particular that the PIN used to access any Really Smart Apps is not the same one as that used to access the mobile device.</p>
